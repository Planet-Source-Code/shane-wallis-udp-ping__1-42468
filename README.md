### Description

This util will UDP Ping 254 IP's in under 3 seconds. Unlike TCP Pings which can take a minute or more. This util will scan a whole IP range quickly telling you which machines on the LAN or internet are alive. umm, since ocx's aren't allowed to be u/l i have had to delete the ocx fromt he zip. In the code just delete any reference to the ocx. The ocx is only a gif animation thing so isn't needed for this util to function. If you would like the full version then d/l at http://www.iamalive.0catch.com/VBstuff/vb.htm
 
### More Info
 
Just an IP address xxx.xxx.xxx
